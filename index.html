    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The month was november.</p>
    <p>The rains had already been falling for nearly two weeks. All roads out of town were cut off, save one.</p>
    <p>This road contained a rickety old wooden rope bridge.</p>
    <p>A lone traveller carefully tested the soundness of the bridge by shaking the nearest splayed cord. With trepidation, he began to ease his way onto the bridge.</p>
	<p>The wind was going through his hair, though you couldn't see it. He feared for the status of the bridge as he approached the middle and his weight shifted its ropes.</p>
    <p>Just as he steeled his will, clenched his jaw and determined to set forth, he became aware of gentle, yet rhythmic vibrations in the ropes clenched in his fists.
       The man turned his head slightly, still fearful of the precarious bridge he stood upon. As his gaze scanned the trees behind him, a resounding bellow tore through the branches, flinging leaves and debris toward his back.  </p>
