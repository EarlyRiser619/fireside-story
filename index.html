    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The month was november.</p>
    <p>The rains had already been falling for nearly two weeks. All roads out of town were cut off, save one.</p>
    <p>This road contained a rickety old wooden rope bridge.</p>
    <p>A lone traveller carefully tested the soundness of the bridge by shaking the nearest splayed cord. With trepidation, he began to ease his way onto the bridge.</p>
