    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The month was november.</p>
    <p>The rains had already been falling for nearly two weeks. All roads out of town were cut off, save one.</p>
    <p>This road contained a rickety old wooden rope bridge.</p>
    <p>A lone traveller carefully tested the soundness of the bridge by shaking the nearest splayed cord. With trepidation, he began to ease his way onto the bridge.</p>
	<p>The wind was going through his hair, though you couldn't see it. He feared for the status of the bridge as he approached the middle and his weight shifted its ropes.</p>
